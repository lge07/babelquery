# BabelQuery

A "mirror" of the HTTP BabelNet API, returning Python objects, since all of the Python ones are shafted :). Doesn't include any of the "sources" parameters, if you would like to use them, it would be advisable to add them on your own.

More documentation will come as I finish, since I need to write something to strip out unnecessary data.
